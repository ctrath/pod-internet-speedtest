# pod-internet-speedtest

Deploys a daemonset with host networking on each node with the Ookla speedtest utility

## Deploy
Simply run:
`kubectl apply -f speedtestds.yaml`

## Running
It takes a couple minutes to install the necessary packages for the speedtest app.  Pod status
may show `Running`, but the speedtest app may not be installed yet.

#### To check if the speedtest app is installed:
- run `kubectl get po -l name=speedtest-ds -o wide`
  This will display all the speedtest pods.  There will be one per each node.
- Copy the name of a speedtest pod and run the following: `kubectl logs <podname>` where <podname> is substituted with the actual name like:
  `speedtest-ds-r5sp7`
- If the speedtest app has been deployed, you will see this line in the log `<<<<< READY!!! >>>>>`
- If not, continue to get the pod logs until that line appears

#### Executing speedtest
Once the speedtest app is installed in a give pod:
- run `kubectl get po -l name=speedtest-ds -o wide`
  This will display all the speedtest pods.  There will be one per each node.
- for each pod run `kubectl exec <podname> -- speedtest --accept-license`

Output should be similar to the following:
```
‚ùØ kubectl exec speedtest-ds-r5sp7 -- speedtest --accept-license

  Results should be similar for each node.  If not, there is likely an issue with the node or network in which the test was run.
